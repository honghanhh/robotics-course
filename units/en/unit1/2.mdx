# LeRobot: An End-to-End Robot Learning Library

Now that we've learnt some history, let's explore the main python library that we will be using throughout the course, LeRobot.

*LeRobot is the open-source library for end-to-end robotics developed by Hugging Face. The library is vertically integrated on the entire robotics stack, supporting low-level control of real-world robot devices, advanced data and inference optimizations, as well as SOTA robot learning methods with simple implementations in pure PyTorch.*

By "vertically integrated", we mean that LeRobot provides a unified interface for handling real-world robots, multi-modal, time-series data, and it is designed to play nicely with the PyTorch and Hugging Face ecosystems. In short, LeRobot is intended to be used as a single library for all your robotics needs.

<Tip>

**Supported Robots:** LeRobot currently supports accessible platforms such as **SO-100/SO-101** (3D‑printable arms) and **ALOHA/ALOHA‑2** (bimanual manipulation). For the up‑to‑date list of supported platforms, see the [official documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot).

LeRobot also implements a unified, low-level approach to reading/writing robot configurations to extend support for other robot platforms with relatively low effort. The library introduces `LeRobotDataset`, a native robotics dataset format currently being used by the open-source community to efficiently record and share datasets.

LeRobot also supports many state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms in robot learning, with efficient implementations in PyTorch, and extended support to experimentation and experiments tracking. Lastly, LeRobot defines a custom, optimized inference stack for robotic policies decoupling action planning from action execution, proving effective in guaranteeing more adaptability at runtime.

**Performance Note:** LeRobot's optimized inference stack is crucial for real-time robot control, where delays of even milliseconds can affect performance. This separation of planning and execution is a key innovation.
