# Course Overview and Learning Path

Welcome to the Robot Learning Tutorial! This course will take you on a journey from classical robotics to modern learning-based approaches.

<Tip>

**New to robotics?** Don't worry! This tutorial is designed to be accessible to anyone with basic programming knowledge. We'll build up the concepts step by step, starting from the fundamentals.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this course, you will have developed both theoretical understanding and practical skills in robot learning. 

The **core concepts** section will guide you through the fundamental shift happening in robotics today. You'll understand why the field is evolving from classical, model-based approaches to data-driven learning methods, how machine learning is transforming robot control systems, and the crucial role that large-scale datasets play in enabling modern robotic capabilities.

From a **practical perspective**, you'll gain hands-on experience with LeRobot, Hugging Face's comprehensive robotics library. You'll learn to work with complex robotics datasets, understand different learning paradigms such as reinforcement learning and behavioral cloning, and implement state-of-the-art robot learning algorithms using real code examples.

The course also covers **real-world applications** that demonstrate the power of these techniques. You'll explore how robots can learn complex behaviors from human demonstrations, understand the principles behind building generalist robotic systems that work across different tasks and environments, and discover how foundation models are scaling robotics capabilities to unprecedented levels.

**Time Commitment:** Each unit takes approximately 30-45 minutes to complete. We recommend taking breaks between units to let the concepts sink in.

## Learning Path

This tutorial follows a carefully structured progression designed to build your understanding systematically.

**Foundations (Units 2-3):** We begin by establishing why learning-based approaches are necessary in modern robotics. You'll first explore the motivation behind robot learning and get hands-on experience with LeRobot's tools and dataset format. Then we'll examine classical robotics approaches in detail, understanding their strengths and fundamental limitations that motivate the shift toward learning-based methods.

**Learning Paradigms (Units 4-5):** *Coming in future updates* - These units will explore the core learning approaches that power modern robotics. You'll dive into reinforcement learning, where robots learn through trial and error, and imitation learning, where robots learn by observing and copying expert demonstrations.

**Modern Approaches (Unit 6):** *Coming in future updates* - The final section will cover cutting-edge developments in robotics foundation models, showing how large-scale pre-training and multi-task learning are creating more general and capable robotic systems.

## Before We Begin

<Tip>

**Prerequisites:**
- **Essential:** Basic Python programming (variables, functions, loops)
- **Helpful:** Elementary linear algebra and calculus
- **Bonus:** General machine learning concepts (not required - we'll explain as we go!)

**Don't have a robot?** No problem! You can follow along with simulated environments and datasets. The concepts translate directly to real hardware when you're ready.

## Getting Started with LeRobot

Throughout this course, we'll use LeRobot, Hugging Face's comprehensive open-source robotics library that democratizes access to state-of-the-art robot learning techniques. LeRobot addresses one of the biggest barriers in robotics education and research: the complexity of working with real robotic systems and data.

The library provides intuitive dataset handling that makes working with complex robotics data as straightforward as working with text or images in traditional machine learning. You'll have access to pre-trained models that serve as strong starting points for your own projects, allowing you to build upon proven algorithms rather than starting from scratch. LeRobot also supports deployment on real robotic hardware, bridging the gap between simulation and real-world applications. Perhaps most importantly, it connects you to a growing community of robot learning practitioners, from researchers at leading institutions to hobbyists building amazing projects at home.

<Tip>

**Installation Preview:** We'll walk through installing LeRobot in Unit 2, but if you're eager to get started:

```bash
pip install lerobot
```

Check out the [LeRobot GitHub repository](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) for more details!
