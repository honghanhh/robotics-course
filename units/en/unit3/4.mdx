# Control Systems and Their Limitations

## Differential Kinematics: A Smarter Approach

Instead of solving for joint positions directly, we can work with **velocities**:

### The Key Insight
If we know the relationship between joint velocities and end-effector velocities, we can control motion more smoothly:

$$\dot{p} = J(q) \dot{q}$$

Where $J(q)$ is the **Jacobian matrix** - the relationship between joint and task space velocities.

### Differential IK Solution
Given a desired end-effector velocity $\dot{p}^*$, find joint velocities:

$$\dot{q} = J(q)^+ \dot{p}^*$$

Where $J(q)^+$ is the **pseudo-inverse** of the Jacobian.

## Adding Feedback Control

<p><em>Dealing with moving obstacles requires feedback control.</em></p>
</div>

Real environments are **dynamic and uncertain**. We need feedback to handle:
- **Modeling errors** - Our equations aren't perfect
- **Disturbances** - Unexpected forces or obstacles  
- **Sensor noise** - Measurements have uncertainty

### Feedback Control Solution
Combine desired motion with error correction:

$$\dot{q} = J(q)^+ (\dot{p}^* + k_p \Delta p)$$

Where $\Delta p = p^* - p(q)$ is the position error.

## Why Classical Approaches Struggle

<p><em>Four key limitations of dynamics-based robotics approaches.</em></p>
</div>

### 1. ðŸ”§ **Integration Challenges**
Classical pipelines are built from **separate modules**:
- Sensing â†’ State Estimation â†’ Planning â†’ Control â†’ Actuation

**Problems:**
- Errors compound through the pipeline
- Brittle when any component fails
- Hard to adapt to new tasks or robots

### 2. ðŸ“ˆ **Limited Scalability**  
Traditional methods struggle with:
- **High-dimensional sensor data** (cameras, LIDAR)
- **Multi-task scenarios** (each task needs custom planning)
- **Multi-modal integration** (vision + touch + proprioception)

### 3. ðŸ§® **Modeling Limitations**
Real-world physics is complex:
- **Contact dynamics** - Hard to model precisely
- **Deformable objects** - Beyond rigid-body assumptions
- **Friction and compliance** - Difficult to characterize

### 4. ðŸ“Š **Ignoring Data Trends**
Classical methods don't leverage:
- **Growing robotics datasets** - Millions of demonstrations available
- **Cross-robot learning** - Insights from other platforms
- **Community knowledge** - Decentralized data collection

## The Learning Alternative

<hfoptions id="robotics-approaches">
<hfoption id="classical">

**Classical Robotics Approach:**

```
Perception â†’ State Estimation â†’ Planning â†’ Control â†’ Actuation
```

**Challenges:**
- Each module needs expert tuning
- Errors compound through pipeline  
- Hard to adapt to new tasks/robots
- Requires precise world models

</hfoption>
<hfoption id="learning">

**Learning-Based Approach:**

```
Raw Sensors â†’ Neural Network â†’ Actions
```

**Benefits:**
- âœ… **Learn from data** - Use demonstrations and experience
- âœ… **End-to-end training** - Optimize the entire pipeline together  
- âœ… **Generalize across tasks** - Share knowledge between different objectives
- âœ… **Adapt to new robots** - Transfer insights across platforms

</hfoption>
</hfoptions>

This is the promise of **robot learning**!

<Tip>

**The Best of Both Worlds:** Modern robot learning often combines classical insights with learning. For example:
- Use physics knowledge to structure neural networks
- Combine learning with safety constraints from control theory
- Initialize learning with classical solutions

Pure learning vs pure classical is a false dichotomy - hybrid approaches often work best!

</Tip>
