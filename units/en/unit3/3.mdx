# Understanding Robot Kinematics

Let's explore how traditional robotics approaches robot control through a concrete example.

## From Complex to Simple: The SO-100 Example

The SO-100 is a 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot arm. To understand the principles, let's simplify it to a **2-DOF planar manipulator** by constraining some joints.

## The Simplified Robot

Our simplified robot has:
- **Two joints** with angles θ₁ and θ₂  
- **Two links** of equal length *l*
- **Configuration** q = [θ₁, θ₂] ∈ [-π, +π]²

## Forward Kinematics: From Joints to Position

**Question:** Given joint angles θ₁ and θ₂, where is the end-effector?

**Answer:** We can calculate the end-effector position mathematically:

$$p(q) = \begin{pmatrix} l \cos(\theta_1) + l \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) \\ l \sin(\theta_1) + l \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2) \end{pmatrix}$$

This is called **Forward Kinematics (FK)** - mapping from joint space to task space.

<Tip>

**Understanding the Math:** This equation comes from basic trigonometry! 
- First link: endpoint at $(l \cos(\theta_1), l \sin(\theta_1))$
- Second link: starts from first link's end, rotated by $\theta_1 + \theta_2$
- Final position: sum of both link contributions

**Why it matters:** FK is relatively easy - given joint angles, we can always compute where the robot's hand is. The hard part is the reverse...

</Tip>

## Inverse Kinematics: From Position to Joints

**Question:** Given a desired end-effector position p*, what joint angles should we use?

**Answer:** This is **Inverse Kinematics (IK)** - much harder to solve!

We need to solve: $p(q) = p^*$

In general, this becomes an optimization problem:
$$\min_{q \in \mathcal{Q}} \|p(q) - p^*\|_2^2$$

<Tip warning={true}>

**Why IK is Hard:**
- **Multiple solutions** - Same end position can be reached with different joint angles
- **No solution** - Some positions are unreachable (outside workspace)
- **Nonlinear equations** - Trigonometric functions make analytical solutions difficult
- **Constraints** - Joint limits and obstacles further complicate the problem

This is why robotics engineers spend so much time on IK algorithms!

## The Challenge of Constraints

Real robots face **constraints**:
- **Physical limits** - Can't move through the floor
- **Obstacles** - Must avoid collisions  
- **Joint limits** - Finite range of motion

These constraints make the feasible configuration space $\mathcal{Q}$ much more complex!

## Key Insight

Even for this **simple 2-DOF robot**, solving IK with constraints is non-trivial. Real robots have:
- **6+ degrees of freedom**
- **Complex geometries**  
- **Dynamic environments**
- **Uncertain models**

Traditional approaches require **extensive mathematical modeling** and **expert knowledge** for each specific case.

**Next:** Let's see how differential kinematics tries to make this more tractable, and where it still struggles.
