## What We've Learned So Far

First, a quick recap of the important concepts covered across the foundational units.

<!-- TODO: Small timeline diagram with milestones: Classical → Kinematics → Control → Limitations → Learning motivation. -->

**Motivation for Learning-Based Robotics:** You've explored the fundamental shift occurring in robotics today, moving from classical model-based approaches toward data-driven learning methods. We've established why robot learning is becoming essential for creating more capable and generalizable robotic systems, and how tools like LeRobot are making these advanced techniques accessible to a broader community of researchers and practitioners.

**LeRobot Ecosystem:** You've gained a fundamental understanding of LeRobot's approach to robotics. This includes understanding the vision behind LeRobot as an end-to-end robotics library, aiming at integrating the different aspects of robotics altogether. You have also learned about the LeRobotDataset format, which handles the complexity of multi-modal robotics data, and got practical experience with loading and processing real robotics datasets for machine learning applications.

Next, you will learn how to synthetize autonomous control behaviors directly from data, and deploy them on real-world robots using lerobot.

**Classical Robotics Foundations:** We've examined the traditional approaches to robotics in detail, covering different types of robot motion including manipulation, locomotion, and mobile manipulation. You've learned about forward and inverse kinematics, differential kinematics, and feedback control systems. Most importantly, you've developed an understanding of why classical approaches, despite their mathematical rigor, struggle with the complexity and variability of real-world robotic applications.

## The Learning Revolution

Through our exploration of classical robotics, you've gained a clear understanding of why learning-based approaches represent such a significant advancement in the field.

**Classical approaches face fundamental limitations** that become apparent when dealing with real-world complexity. These methods require extensive mathematical modeling of every aspect of the robot's environment and interactions, which becomes prohibitively difficult for complex scenarios.

They struggle to integrate multi-modal data sources like vision, touch, and proprioception in a unified way. Perhaps most importantly, classical approaches don't scale well across different tasks or robot embodiments—each new application typically requires significant re-engineering and expert knowledge.

**Learning-based approaches offer compelling advantages** that directly address these limitations. Instead of requiring experts to model every aspect of the problem, these methods can learn appropriate behaviors and representations directly from data.

They naturally handle multi-modal, high-dimensional inputs through neural network architectures designed for such complexity, can generalize across different tasks and even different robot embodiments, and scale with the availability of data and computational resources.

## What's Coming Next

The foundational knowledge you've gained prepares you for the advanced topics that follow. 

**Reinforcement Learning for Robotics** will explore how robots can learn optimal behaviors through trial and error interactions with their environment. You'll learn about designing appropriate reward signals for robotics tasks, understand reinforcement learning methods that enable robots to improve their performance over time, and tackle the crucial challenge of sample efficiency—learning effectively with limited real-world interaction data. We'll also cover how LeRobot implements these reinforcement learning algorithms in practice.

**Imitation Learning via Behavioral Cloning** will demonstrate how robots can acquire complex skills by observing and copying expert demonstrations. This approach is particularly valuable because it allows robots to learn from real-world human expertise without requiring explicit reward engineering, sidestepping the criticalities associated with using RL in practice. You'll understand how to handle the distribution shift problem that occurs when robots encounter situations not seen in training data, explore advanced imitation learning techniques beyond simple behavioral cloning, and gain practical experience implementing these methods using LeRobot's tools.

**Foundation Models for Robotics** will cover the cutting-edge developments that are creating more general and capable robotic systems. You'll explore how multi-task learning enables knowledge sharing across different robotic platforms and tasks, understand language-conditioned policies that allow robots to follow natural language instructions, and learn about scaling laws that govern how performance improves with larger models and datasets. This section will prepare you to understand and contribute to the development of truly generalist robotic systems.

## Practical Skills Gained

Through this foundational section of the course, you've developed both technical capabilities and conceptual understanding that will serve as the foundation for more advanced topics.

**Technical Skills:** You now understand how robotics data differs from traditional machine learning datasets and why specialized formats are necessary. You've gained practical experience working with the LeRobotDataset API, including loading and processing multi-modal robotics data that combines vision, proprioception, and action information. You've also learned about streaming large datasets efficiently, which is crucial for working with the massive datasets that power modern robot learning systems.

**Conceptual Understanding:** Perhaps most importantly, you've developed a clear mental model of the evolution occurring in robotics today. You understand the historical context of classical approaches, their mathematical foundations, and their fundamental limitations when applied to complex, real-world scenarios. You've gained insight into how learning-based approaches address these limitations and why the availability of large-scale robotics data is transforming what's possible in the field.
